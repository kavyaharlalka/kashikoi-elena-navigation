# Problem Statement

Navigation Systems typically provide the shortest path between any two given points. These are not optimal for a lot of scenarios where the user is interested in finding a path which has the least elevation gain. Moreover, some users might be interested in finding a path which has elevation gain so that they can partake in an intense and time-constrained workout. To extend navigation systems to solve the above problems, we have designed a software system that takes two points as input and finds the optimal route between them that maximizes or minimizes elevation gain while limiting the total path distance to n% of the shortest path between these two points.

# Steps to Run the Application
